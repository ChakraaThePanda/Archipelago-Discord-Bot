## Quick Start

### 1. Install Node.js
Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it.

### 2. Create a Discord bot
1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → **New Application**
2. Under **Bot**: click **Reset Token** and copy your token. Enable **Server Members Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents.
3. Under **General Information**: copy your **Application ID**
4. Under **OAuth2**: generate an invite URL with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes and the **View Channels** + **Send Messages** + **Embed Links** permissions, then invite the bot to your server

### 3. Get your CheeseTrackers API key
Log in at CheeseTrackers → click your profile → copy your API key.

### 4. Configure and run
Open `bot/archipelago.conf`, fill in the three values, then double-click `bot/run.bat`.

The bat will open the config file for you automatically if it isn't filled in yet, and will install dependencies on its own on the first run.
